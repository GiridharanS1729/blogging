# 🌐 Blogging Website

Welcome to the **Blogging Website**! This project features a modern, stylish header component for your blog, built with React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ✨ Features

- **🎨 Responsive Header**: Stylish gradient background and sticky positioning.
- **🔗 Interactive Navigation**: Hover and active effects for a smooth user experience.
- **🖋️ Styled Components**: Clean and functional CSS for the header and navigation.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `src/`
  - `components/`
    - `Header.js` - React component for the header.
  - `styles/`
    - `ts.css` - CSS styles for the header component.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blogging-website.git
   cd blogging-website
   ```

Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the Development Server

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

💻 Usage
To use the Header component in your application, import it as follows:

jsx
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import Header from './components/Header';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      {/* Add other components and content here */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
🎨 Customization
Feel free to customize the Header component and ts.css to match your blog's design. Modify the CSS properties in ts.css to change colors, spacing, and other styles.
